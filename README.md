# Visualizing Unspervised Problems' Datasets

You can visualize unsupervised datasets using clustring techniques or decompositions techniques as PCA or t-SNE.

This Visualization usually make it easier for me to understand the data and problem better.

In this notebook I am using the MNIST dataset as an example and t-SNE to check the results of this approach.
